# ADS-Sorting
 [Algorithms and data structures] Sorting by different ways an array containing integers or real numbers in Pascal.  
 The program allows the user to define an array of integers or real numbers (depending on the user's choice) of the sizes: n = 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1,000,000, 2,000,000, 5,000,000, 10,000,000. The program allows you to sort a previously filled array of numbers with the following sorting algorithms:
- bubble sort
- sorting by selection (selection sort)
- sorting by insertion (insertion sort)
- merge sort
- counting sort - only integers
- sorting by heap (heap sort)
- bucket sort
- quick sort

The program has the following functions:
- measuring the sorting time of the selected algorithm
- sorting an array of any size (size is given by the user)
- sorting the same data using different algorithms
- saving to the text file the results of experiments in the form of a table: name of sorting, results in ms for individual table sizes
- running and measuring the sorting time of all (one by one) sorting algorithms for a user-defined array.  
  
Program written in Lazarus 1.8.2 64bit.
